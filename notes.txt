ways to do it 

load entire file then use the regex to insert at the correct position
    not ideal for large files due to memory intensive 
    leads to performance issues

load file in chunks using streams 
    sequential in nature, will need to read up to the insert point, keeping track of the state 
    best used when random access is not required
    increased complexity + need buffering to perform random access
